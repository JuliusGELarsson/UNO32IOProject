# UNO32IOProject
Project in the course IS1200 where me and another student made a snake game. 
The game is played on a chipkit with an I/O shield and has classic snake rules.
The rules and the description is located in "Projekt_IS1200.pdf"

The file "Helloworld.c" contains no relevant code since i can not publicly display it.
